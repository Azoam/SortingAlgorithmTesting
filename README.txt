Algorithm Testing Repo

To practice sorting algorithms further, I've decided to create this repo. I understand that these algorithms will lack many things (duplicate checking, specific order, etc.), but
I plan for this repo to be a stepping stone to further my understanding of sorting algorithms. Of course if anyone besides my self sees this and believes there is some 
valuable feedback to be given, by all means contact me. Thank you!
